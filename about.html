                        <p>
                            I’m a 20 year-old Software Engineer currently
                            based in New York City. Technology has fascinated me from 
                            a very young age. At the age of 9, I began uploading YouTube videos
                            and diving into video editing software. I then became interested in graphic design,
                            and began designing at the age of 13. This passion transitioned into something greater after 
                            I fell in love with cameras and photography at the age of 15. I have always been interested on
                            how things work, and why they work. Having creative freedom is huge for me, and being able to develop
                            my ideas and push them farther than what is in my head is what intrigues me about software development.
                            I began programming a few years ago and haven't looked back. My wish is to develop software and further
                            ideas that change the way people around us interact with the world around them.
                            I am currently a senior at The State University of New York at Albany, 
                            pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science. Everything featured on this
                            website has been designed or developed by me, and I genuinely hope you enjoy my work. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Thanks, <br>
